# client

The client is written on
[React](https://reactjs.org/). The state is managed by [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)
which is similar to Redux but I've found it easier to pick up, understand and manage.

More information on React and how this project was created, on the ./REACT.md

## MobX

There are some basic tutorials:

* https://mobx.js.org/getting-started


## Packages Used

* Build managment: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Style and CSS: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

# Setup

## Node

The project currently runs on Node 12.

Instructions can be found here: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node@12

**brew**
```bash
brew install node@12
```

## Yarn

There is no significan difference between Yarn and NPM for package management.
There is a breakdown on how they operate here: https://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm/.

However the project right now is using Yarn 3 since it just is slightly better and makes
running comands easier. It also allows for yarn to be configured by project.

The Yarn documentation can be found here https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started

Install Yarn base version 1.22 and then set the project to run on Yarn 2:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
yarn set version berry
```
